This is a classifier that merges Neural Networks with Bernoulli Naive Bayes. It employs a fully connected, 3-layer neural network implemented in NumPy for predicting priors which are then input into Bernoulli Naive Bayes for the final prediction 🌐 It is designed to play PacMan autonomously by contributing the probability of the next best move based on the current enviroment state (food, pellets, ghost locations)

#Features
🤖Hybrid Model: Combines neural networks and Naive Bayes for intelligent probabilies.
🔢NumPy Based: Efficient matrix operations and computations.
⚙️Customisable: Easily adjust layers, learning rate, and iterations.
📊One-hot Encoding Utility: Convert integer lists to one-hot encoded numpy arrays.

## How To Use
### Import the Classifier.
from hybrid_classifier import Classifier

### Initialize the Classifier with desired hyper-parameters.
clf = Classifier(layers=[25,8,4], learning_rate=0.005, iterations=100)

### Train the model using data.
clf.fit(good_moves_data, target)

### Predict using a given state of Pacman.
best_move = clf.predict(state_data, legal)
